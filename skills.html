        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment:</strong> <br> 
                I have practical experience in performing vulnerability assessments, including network scanning with Nmap, OSINT research, and developing custom tools to identify exposed resources and verify email leaks. I have also studied VA/PT modules.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Network Security:</strong><br> 
                 I have solid skills in Linux network configuration, subnetting, routing, and using tools like Wireshark and Nmap. I can configure firewalls (UFW, iptables) and have hands-on experience with Packet Tracer (VLAN, trunking, static routing, OSPF).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Incident Response:</strong><br> 
                 I have a foundational knowledge of threat detection and security auditing. My experience in system monitoring with tools like journalctl, top, and netstat, combined with my auditing skills, provides a strong starting point for developing my capabilities in the field of incident response.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Red Teaming:</strong><br> 
                Although I don't have direct experience in full-scale Red Teaming, my skills in Vulnerability Assessment, OSINT, and developing custom scanning tools align perfectly with the offensive security mindset required in this area.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Security Operations:</strong><br> 
                I am proficient in hardening Linux systems, performing audits, and managing users and permissions. I have experience using threat detection tools like rkhunter and ClamAV.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Linux & Windows Administration:</strong><br> 
                I am skilled in Linux system administration and am familiar with Windows operating systems. I have experience with virtualized systems (VirtualBox, VMware) and middleware like Samba.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Python Scripting:</strong><br> 
                I am a competent Python scripter, specializing in creating tools for networking, automation, and OSINT analysis. I also have experience with Bash scripting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):</strong><br> 
                I have a basic understanding of auditing and logging on Linux, using commands like journalctl to monitor system events. These skills provide an excellent foundation for understanding how SIEM systems work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Firewall & IDS/IPS Management:</strong><br> 
                I have hands-on experience configuring and managing firewalls such as UFW and iptables on Linux, which are essential for protecting network infrastructures.
